            <h2>ðŸ§µ About Crafts</h2>
            <p>
              Crafts are a wonderful way to express creativity and make something beautiful with your own hands. From paper to thread, anything can become art.
              <br><br>
              Crafting is the art of turning simple materials into meaningful, beautiful creations using creativity and hands-on techniques. It includes a variety of activities like paper quilling, origami, embroidery, pottery, upcycling, and more. For many, itâ€™s not just a hobbyâ€”but a way to express emotions, reduce stress, and connect with their inner artist.
              <br><br>
              For me, crafting is a form of meditation. I enjoy every moment of cutting, folding, gluing, and decorating. One of my favorite things to create is greeting cards using quilling paper. Each swirl, shape, and color combination tells a story. I also enjoy transforming recyclable materialslike cardboard, bottles, and newspapers into decorative items. It makes me feel creative and eco-conscious at the same time!
              <br><br>
              Every handmade item I create holds a piece of my heart. Whether itâ€™s a birthday card for a loved one or a wall hanging made with waste materials, I make sure each detail is filled with love. Seeing a smile on someoneâ€™s face when they receive something I made is the most rewarding feeling.
              <br><br>
              One of the best parts of crafting is being able to reuse and repurpose items. Old magazines, boxes, jars, and buttons often get a second life as decorative art. Crafting not only promotes creativity but also encourages mindful, sustainable living.
